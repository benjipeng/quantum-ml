# LaTeX Writing Guidelines for CS/ML Research Papers

## Purpose
This rule provides guidelines for writing LaTeX documents for computer science and machine learning research papers intended for arxiv.org and the CS/ML academic community.

## Writing Style

### Word Choice
- Avoid these overused academic terms: "delve", "moreover", "furthermore", "pivotal", "tapestry", "vital", "comprehensive", "embark", "notably", "excels", "undoubtedly", "landscape", "vibrant", "arguably", "catalyst", "engage", "seamlessly", "paradigm", "optimize", "framework"
- Maintain precise technical terminology where appropriate for CS/ML concepts
- Choose clear, effective language over flowery or verbose expressions

### Document Structure
- Write direct, clear content without unnecessary repetition
- Do not overuse summary sections at the end of sections unless needed
- Focus on communicating ideas efficiently without redundancy
- Organize content logically with clear transitions between concepts

## LaTeX Formatting
- Use consistent mathematical notation throughout the paper
- Follow standard LaTeX practices for the arxiv.org CS/ML community
- Structure sections with appropriate \section, \subsection commands
- Use proper BibTeX citations following standard CS conference formats

## Code Examples (if needed)
- Format code snippets using appropriate LaTeX environments (e.g., listings or minted)
- Ensure algorithms are presented using algorithm/algorithmic environments
- Maintain consistent code style across all examples

## Figure Guidelines
- Create clear, informative figures with appropriate captions
- Ensure all figures are referenced in the text
- Use vector graphics when possible for better quality

## Bibliography Management

### Citation Format
- Use the standard `\cite{key}` command for in-text citations (e.g., `\cite{smith2023neural}` or `\cite{smith2023neural, jones2022deep}` for multiple citations)

### BibTeX Management
- Store all references in a separate `.bib` file
- Follow Google Scholar's BibTeX format for consistency:
  - Use descriptive, consistent citation keys in the format `firstauthorYYYYkeyword` (e.g., `smith2023neural`)
  - Include all essential fields: author, title, journal/booktitle, year, volume, pages, etc.
  - Capitalize proper nouns in titles using curly braces (e.g., `{B}ayesian`)
