As AI and quantum computing continue to evolve, new opportunities for synergy will emerge. This section explores future directions and challenges for AI in quantum computing.

\subsection{Accelerated Quantum Supercomputing Systems}
Future quantum computing platforms will likely integrate classical and quantum processing elements tightly, with AI playing a crucial role in orchestrating computation across these heterogeneous systems.

\subsection{Simulating High Quality Data Sets}
Developing AI models for quantum applications requires access to high-quality training data. Improved classical simulation capabilities will be essential for generating the data needed to train increasingly sophisticated AI models.

\subsection{Increased Multidisciplinary Collaboration}
Advances at the intersection of AI and quantum computing will require deeper collaboration between experts from both fields. Several promising areas for such collaboration include:

\begin{itemize}
    \item Applying diffusion models to more quantum computing tasks beyond unitary synthesis
    \item Developing quantum-specific foundation models tailored to challenges across the quantum computing stack
    \item Using AI to discover entirely new quantum algorithms and algorithmic primitives
    \item Creating hybrid approaches that optimally combine quantum and AI-based methods
\end{itemize}
