Controlling quantum systems with high fidelity presents unique challenges that AI methods are particularly well-suited to address. This section examines how AI is improving quantum device control and optimization.

Reinforcement learning has emerged as a powerful approach for quantum control optimization, allowing the discovery of control sequences that outperform those designed using conventional methods. Key applications include:

\begin{itemize}
    \item Optimizing single and multi-qubit gate implementations
    \item Developing robust control sequences that maintain performance despite system variations
    \item Real-time adaptive control based on measurement feedback
    \item Learning control strategies for complex many-body quantum systems
\end{itemize}

Recent work has demonstrated how reinforcement learning agents can break constraints imposed by adiabatic quantum control \cite{ding2021breaking}, potentially opening new routes to high-fidelity quantum operations.
