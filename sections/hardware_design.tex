This section examines how AI techniques are being applied to quantum hardware design, characterization, and optimization.

\subsection{System Characterization}
AI methods are increasingly employed to characterize quantum systems, addressing challenges in Hamiltonian learning \cite{wiebe2014hamiltonian, gentile2021learning} and noise modeling. Machine learning approaches can extract valuable information about system parameters and environmental interactions from experimental data, often outperforming traditional characterization methods.

\subsection{Platform Design}
The design of quantum computing platforms involves complex optimization challenges across multiple physical layers. AI techniques are helping researchers navigate these design spaces more efficiently, from materials selection to device layout and architecture.

\subsection{Gate and Pulse Optimization}
Quantum gate implementation through optimized control pulses is a critical area where AI has demonstrated significant advantages. Reinforcement learning approaches have proven particularly effective for discovering high-fidelity control pulses \cite{bukov2018reinforcement, ding2021breaking}.
