Before executing quantum algorithms, several preprocessing steps can significantly impact performance. This section explores how AI is enhancing these preparatory phases.

\subsection{Quantum Circuit Synthesis}
Converting algorithms to efficient quantum circuits presents numerous challenges that AI methods are helping to address.

\subsubsection{Unitary Synthesis}
AI techniques are providing new approaches to decomposing arbitrary unitary operations into sequences of available gates, often finding more efficient implementations than traditional decomposition methods.

\subsubsection{AI Models to Generate Compact Circuits}
Recent work with generative models has shown promise in creating more compact circuit representations, potentially reducing resource requirements for quantum algorithms.

\subsection{Circuit Parameter Learning and Parameter Transfer}
For parameterized quantum circuits, finding optimal parameters is challenging due to issues like barren plateaus. AI methods can help navigate these complex optimization landscapes more effectively.

\subsection{State Preparation}
Preparing specific quantum states efficiently is crucial for many algorithms. AI approaches are helping develop improved state preparation protocols that require fewer operations and are more robust to noise.
