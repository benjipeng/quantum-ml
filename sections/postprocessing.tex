After quantum computation, various postprocessing techniques can enhance the value of measurement results. This section examines how AI is improving these final stages of the quantum computing workflow.

\subsection{Efficient Observable Estimation and Tomography}
AI methods are enhancing our ability to extract information from limited measurement data, a crucial capability given the cost of quantum computation.

\subsection{Readout Measurements}
Accurate interpretation of measurement results in the presence of readout errors is essential. AI techniques are providing improved methods for:

\begin{itemize}
    \item Readout error mitigation
    \item Discrimination between quantum states
    \item Optimizing measurement procedures
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Error Mitigation Techniques}
Various error mitigation techniques can improve the quality of results from noisy quantum computers. AI methods are enhancing these approaches through:

\begin{itemize}
    \item Learning optimal error extrapolation strategies
    \item Identifying efficient noise-aware circuit transformations
    \item Developing hardware-adaptive error mitigation protocols
\end{itemize}
